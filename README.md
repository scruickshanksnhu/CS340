Module 8 Assignment for CS340
Steven Cruickshank


    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?


The best way to write programs which are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to create module-like building blocks which all maintain a very similar structure. Make sure to comment out your code in a readable and easy-to-understand way. That way when you go back, you're not confused. I think the CRUD module used was very intuitive and understandable. You could include this module within the same code as the Dash framework if you wanted, but I find creating smaller modules and interweaving them creates a much more maintainable code overall. 

The best way to approach a problem as a computer scientist is to first understand the project! Make sure you're documenting the steps needed outside of code. Understand what you're creating and why you're creating it. This project was a large assignment, but by breaking each task down into smaller steps, I was able to understand it better. It can seem overwhelming looking at all the requirements, but when you understand the project, it's easy to take it step by step until everything is complete. It's also easier to understand the problem when you approach the larger project in smaller blocks. I'm definitely going to be using these skills in future work both in-school and out. 

Computer scientists are like problem solvers. Grazioso Salvare approached us with a problem. Their business idea of finding Search and Rescue animals was too laborious, and they wanted to figure out a way to make this easier. As computer scientists, it was our job to create an application which made this easier for them. Computer scientists take these types of problems, and figure out the best way to solve them. In our case, creating a python module that worked with a database as well as a visual dashboard was the best way to handle this. There are often many solutions to problems proposed to a computer scientist, and it is our job to find the most intuitive one. 

Thank you!
